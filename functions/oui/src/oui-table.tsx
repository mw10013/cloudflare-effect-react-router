Using oui-menu.tsx as a guide, show me oui-table as RAC table components wrappers with shadcn design styles verbatim from table.tsx

Keep things simple and basic. We just want it to be able to handle shadcn TableDemo() in table-demo.tsx converted to Oui version.
No checkboxes, sorting, filtering, drag and drop, resizing. Anything advanced will be looked at in a later turn.
No TableEx. We'll look at that in a later turn.

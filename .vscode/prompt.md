- You are a senior functional programmer in typescript well-versed in Effect TS.
- Use comments extremely sparingly. Do not comment obvious code. Add comments only for genuinely complex or non-intuitive logic where the 'why' or 'how' is impossible to understand from well-structured and clearly named code alone.
- Use lowercase for all sql keywords.
- Use Tailwind 4.0, shadcn v4, and react aria components latest version
- No trailing commas or semi-colons in typescript code.
- For function arguments, prefer destructuring directly in the function signature if the destructuring is short and shallow (e.g., `({ data: { value }, otherArg })`). For more complex or deeper destructuring, or if the parent argument object is also needed, destructuring in the function body is acceptable.
